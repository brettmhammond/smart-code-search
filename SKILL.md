description: Semantic search powered by ColGREP and NextPlaid — the #1 retrieval engine on MTEB Code and BrowseComp-Plus. Search codebases, docs, and knowledge bases by meaning, not just keywords. A 17M parameter model running locally on CPU that outperforms 8B parameter embedding models. Sub-second queries, zero API cost, 100% private. Use when searching code for implementations or patterns, navigating unfamiliar projects, finding related docs across repos, searching documentation or notes vaults, or giving coding agents semantic codebase awareness. Triggers on "search the code", "find where", "semantic search", "code search", "smart search", "codebase search", "find implementation", "search docs", "colgrep", "nextplaid".

# Smart Code Search

**Search code and docs by meaning, not just strings.**

Powered by [ColGREP](https://github.com/lightonai/next-plaid) and [NextPlaid](https://lighton.ai/lighton-blogs/introducing-lighton-nextplaid) from LightOn — the engine behind the **#1 ranked code retrieval model on MTEB** and the **#1 retriever on BrowseComp-Plus**, OpenAI's hardest agentic search benchmark.

grep finds strings. This finds intent. Ask "payment capture logic" and get results from files that never contain those exact words — because it understands what your code *does*, not just what it says.

## Why This Exists

Every developer has been here: you know *what* you're looking for but not *where* it lives. You chain 4 different `grep -r` attempts, guess filenames, scroll through directory trees. Coding agents are even worse — they grep, miss things, hallucinate file paths, waste tokens exploring blind.

ColGREP fixes this with **multi-vector semantic search**. It parses your code with Tree-sitter, embeds each function/method/class with token-level vectors, and ranks results by meaning. The model is 17M parameters, runs on CPU, and returns results in under a second.

## The Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **MTEB Code Leaderboard** | #1 ([LateOn-Code](https://lighton.ai/lighton-blogs/lateon-code-colgrep-lighton)) |
| **BrowseComp-Plus** | 87.59% accuracy, beating all models up to 8B params ([blog](https://lighton.ai/lighton-blogs/the-bloated-retriever-era-is-over)) |
| **vs grep in coding agents** | 70% win rate head-to-head |
| **Model size** | 17M params — 54× smaller than competing 8B models |
| **Search latency** | 200–900ms on CPU |
| **API cost** | $0. Forever. Runs 100% local |
| **Privacy** | Code never leaves your machine |

## Install

```bash
brew install lightonai/tap/colgrep
```

Shell installer (Linux/macOS):
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/lightonai/next-plaid/releases/latest/download/colgrep-installer.sh | sh
```

Verify: `colgrep --version`

## Quick Start

### 1. Index Your Project

```bash
cd /path/to/project
colgrep init
```

That's it. ColGREP parses every file with Tree-sitter, builds multi-vector embeddings on CPU, and stores the index in `.colgrep/`. Takes 30–60 seconds for ~1000 files. After this, **the index auto-updates on every search** — changed files are detected and re-indexed automatically.

### 2. Search

```bash
colgrep "natural language description of what you want"
```

Results are ranked by semantic relevance score. Higher = better match.

**Examples:**
```bash
colgrep "authentication middleware token validation"
colgrep "database migration rollback strategy"
colgrep "React form validation with error display"
colgrep "webhook retry logic with exponential backoff"
```

### 3. Combine Regex + Semantics

Filter files by regex pattern first, then rank semantically:

```bash
colgrep -e "async.*await" "error handling patterns"
colgrep -e "def test_" "payment capture edge cases"
colgrep -e "\.tsx$" "patient dashboard layout"
```

## Search Options

```bash
colgrep "query"              # Default output: file:lines (score: X.XX)
colgrep "query" --json       # JSON output for piping to other tools
colgrep "query" -n 5         # Top 5 results only
```

## When to Use This vs grep

| You know... | Use |
|-------------|-----|
| The exact string or function name | `grep -r "functionName"` |
| The concept but not the words | `colgrep "what it does"` |
| A pattern + a concept | `colgrep -e "pattern" "meaning"` |
| Where something is implemented | `colgrep "description of behavior"` |
| How a feature works across files | `colgrep "feature workflow"` |

## Coding Agent Integration

### Claude Code (recommended)

```bash
colgrep --install-claude-code
```

Restart Claude Code after installing. Every Claude Code session in an indexed project gets semantic search automatically. Agents find the right files on their own instead of blind grepping.

### Other Agents (OpenCode, Codex)

```bash
colgrep --install-opencode
colgrep --install-codex
```

## Multi-Project Setup

Index each project independently. Search from the project directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/api && colgrep init
cd ~/code/frontend && colgrep init
cd ~/code/infrastructure && colgrep init
cd ~/docs && colgrep init

# Search each independently
cd ~/code/api && colgrep "payment processing service"
cd ~/code/frontend && colgrep "checkout form validation"
```

Works great for monorepos, microservices, documentation vaults, and any directory with text/code files.

## How It Works

ColGREP uses **ColBERT late-interaction retrieval** — a fundamentally different approach than traditional single-vector embeddings:

1. **Tree-sitter** parses your code into structured units (functions, methods, classes, signatures)
2. **LateOn-Code-edge** (17M params) creates **multiple token-level embeddings** per code unit — not one lossy summary vector
3. **NextPlaid** stores these in a quantized, memory-mapped Rust index
4. At search time, query tokens interact with document tokens for **fine-grained relevance scoring**

This is why a 17M model beats 8B models — late interaction preserves token-level semantics that single-vector approaches compress away. Read the full technical story: [The Bloated Retriever Era Is Over](https://lighton.ai/lighton-blogs/the-bloated-retriever-era-is-over)

## Interpreting Scores

- **6.0+** — Near-exact conceptual match. The code does exactly what you described.
- **5.0–6.0** — Strong semantic match. Highly relevant code.
- **4.0–5.0** — Good match. Related code worth reviewing.
- **3.0–4.0** — Weak match. May or may not be relevant.
- **Below 3.0** — Likely noise. Ignore these results.

## Troubleshooting

**"Index is being updated by another process"** — Another colgrep instance is updating. Current search uses existing index. Safe to ignore.

**Re-index from scratch:**
```bash
rm -rf .colgrep/ && colgrep init
```

**Add to .gitignore:**
```
.colgrep/
```
